            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> The mind map reveals how corporate railroad-mining interests orchestrated the largest Indigenous land grab in American history (150M→48M acres) while the General Strike of enslaved people briefly forced consideration of Black land ownership. Both were ultimately defeated by systematic white supremacist terrorism that ended Reconstruction, then redirected "democratic" land reform toward westward expansion and racial exclusion.
